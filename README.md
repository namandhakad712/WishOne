# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list

# WishOne App

## Contact Form Email Setup

This application includes a contact form on the Help page that sends emails using Gmail SMTP.

### Setting Up the Email Server

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the email server:
   ```
   npm run server
   ```
   This will start the server on port 3001.

3. Start the application:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. The contact form on the Help page will now send emails to your Gmail account.

### How It Works

- When users fill out the contact form on the Help page, the form data is sent to the API endpoint.
- The server uses Nodemailer with Gmail SMTP to send an email to your address.
- Different contact types (App Support, Bug Report, Feature Suggestion) have different subject line formats for easy categorization.
- All emails are sent to `codinggeneraltutorials@gmail.com`.

### Troubleshooting

- If you're having issues with authentication, make sure your Gmail account has 2-factor authentication enabled and you're using an app password.
- Check the server console for error messages if emails aren't being sent.
- The server must be running on port 3001 for the form to work correctly.
